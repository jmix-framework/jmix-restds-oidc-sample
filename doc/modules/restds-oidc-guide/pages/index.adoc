= REST DataStore with External Authentication

This guide shows how to use the xref:rest-ds:index.adoc[Jmix REST DataStore] together with external authentication, using Keycloak as an xref:oidc:index.adoc[OpenID Connect (OIDC)] identity provider.

In distributed systems, it's common for applications to authenticate users centrally but share data and logic between services. With Jmix, you can build secure applications where user data and access control are managed externally, while services communicate through REST APIs and forward user tokens for authentication.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

* Set up a Keycloak server for managing users, roles, and tokens.
* Configure Jmix applications to authenticate users via Keycloak.
* Implement user synchronization between Keycloak and Jmix.
* Use the REST DataStore to access data from another application on behalf of the logged-in user.

The guide covers two architectural patterns:

- **Integrated Applications**: Both the Client and Service applications have UIs and run independently, communicating through REST with token-based authentication.
- **Separate Tiers**: The UI-only Frontend application retrieves data from a Backend service via REST, with all authentication handled through Keycloak.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a working example of both scenarios and understand the key concepts behind integrating REST DataStore with external authentication in a secure and maintainable way.

. xref:ROOT:setup.adoc[Setup] the development environment.

. Clone the https://github.com/jmix-framework/{sample-project}[sample project^] and switch to `{page-origin-branch}` branch:
+
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
git clone https://github.com/jmix-framework/{sample-project}
cd {sample-project}
git checkout {page-origin-branch}
----

[[keycloak-setup]]
=== Set Up Keycloak

. Run Keycloak in a Docker container:
+
[source]
----
docker run -p 8180:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin --name=keycloak quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.1 start-dev
----

. Log in to the Keycloak admin console and create a new realm called `jmix-restds-oidc-sample`.

. Create the following clients in this realm:

* `integrated-apps-client`
** *Capability config* tab:
*** *Client authentication*: On
** *Login settings* tab:
*** *Valid redirect URIs*:  `++http://localhost:8080/*++`, `++http://localhost:8081/*++`
*** *Web origins*:  `+`

* `integrated-apps-service`
** *Capability config* tab:
*** *Client authentication*: On
** *Login settings* tab:
*** *Valid redirect URIs*:  `++http://localhost:8080/*++`, `++http://localhost:8081/*++`
*** *Web origins*:  `+`

* `separate-tiers-frontend`
** *Capability config* tab:
*** *Client authentication*: On
** *Login settings* tab:
*** *Valid redirect URIs*:  `++http://localhost:8080/*++`
*** *Web origins*:  `+`

. For each client, switch to the *Client scopes* tab and open the `[client-name]-dedicated` scope. Add predefined mapper for `realm roles`. Open the created `realm roles` mapper and set the following values:
* *Token Claim Name*: `roles`
* *Add to userinfo*: On

. Create two realm roles: `system-full-access` and `employee`.

. Create two users: `alice` and `bob`. Fill in the *Email*, *First name* and *Last name* attributes. Set user passwords on the *Credentials* tab.

. On the *Role mapping* tab, assign `system-full-access` role to `alice` and `employee` role to `bob`. Use *Filter by realm roles* to find the roles.

[[integrated-applications-example]]
== Integrated Applications Example

In this example, the distributed system consists of two applications: Client and Service.

Both applications have their own databases and UI, and use the Jmix xref:oidc:index.adoc[] add-on to enable user authentication through Keycloak. The Client application accesses customer data through the xref:rest-ds:index.adoc[REST DataStore].

.Integrated Applications Overview
image::integrated-apps-1.svg[align="center"]

The Service application includes the `Customer` JPA entity and customer management views. The Client application has a corresponding `Customer` DTO entity and related views.

.Data Models of the Applications
image::integrated-apps-3.svg[align="center"]

When the Client's REST DataStore makes a request to the Service's REST API, it includes the authorization token of the current user obtained from Keycloak during login. Thus, when executing REST requests, the Service code acts on behalf of the user who is logged into the Client.

.Client/Service Integration Flow
image::integrated-apps-2.svg[align="center"]

Each application has two roles: `system-full-access` and `employee`.

The `employee` role in Service application provides access only to the `Customer` entity and related views. In the Client application, this role also enables managing the `Order` entity.

According to the <<keycloak-setup,Keycloak setup>>, `alice` will be granted the `system-full-access` role and `bob` will be granted the `employee` role.

[[integrated-applications-example-in-action]]
=== Example in Action

. Open the root project in IntelliJ IDEA with the Jmix Studio plugin installed.
+
Launch the `integrated-apps-client` and `integrated-apps-service` applications using their run/debug configurations.
+
The applications are configured to run on different ports: Client on 8080, Service on 8081.

. Open the Client application by navigating to http://localhost:8080[^] in your web browser. You will be redirected to the Keycloak login page.
+
Log in as `bob` with the password that you have set in Keycloak. You will be able to manage customers in `Customer (DTO)` views.
+
Log in as `alice`. Open the list of users and make sure it contains both `bob` and `alice` users with data replicated from Keycloak.

. Open the Service application by navigating to http://localhost:8081[^] in your web browser. You will be redirected to the Keycloak login page.
+
Log in as `alice`. You will be able to manage customers and see the list of users with data replicated from Keycloak.

[[separate-tiers-example]]
== Separate Tiers Example

In this example, the distributed system comprises the Backend and Frontend applications.

The Backend application connects to the database and provides the REST API. The Frontend application features a user interface and retrieves data from the Backend via the xref:rest-ds:index.adoc[REST DataStore].

Both applications use the Jmix xref:oidc:index.adoc[] add-on for integration with Keycloak: the Frontend authenticates users in UI, the Backend validates tokens sent by the Client with REST requests.

.Separate Tiers Overview
image::separate-tiers-1.svg[align="center"]

The data models of the applications have the same structure; however, the Backend includes JPA entities, while the Frontend includes their corresponding DTO entities.

.Data Models of the Applications
image::separate-tiers-2.svg[align="center"]

When the Frontend REST DataStore makes a request to the Backend REST API, it includes the authorization token of the current user obtained from Keycloak during login. Thus, when executing REST requests, the Backend code acts on behalf of the user who is logged into the Frontend.

.Frontend/Backend Integration Flow
image::separate-tiers-3.svg[align="center"]

Each application has two roles: `system-full-access` and `employee`. The `employee` role provides access only to the `Customer` entity and, in the Frontend application, to the corresponding views.

According to the <<keycloak-setup,Keycloak setup>>, `alice` will be granted the `system-full-access` role and `bob` will be granted the `employee` role.

[[summary]]
== Summary

This guide demonstrates how to use REST DataStore with external authentication in Jmix applications, leveraging Keycloak as the OpenID Connect provider. Two architectural patterns are covered:

. Integrated Applications Example

* Client and Service applications run independently, each with their own UI and database.
* The Client accesses the Service's REST API using REST DataStore, forwarding the user's OAuth2 token for authentication.
* Both applications use Jmix OIDC add-on for Keycloak integration, with role-based access control.
* The Service validates incoming OAuth2 tokens and applies the authentication of the user logged into the Client when executing code.

. Separate Tiers Example

* A Frontend application (UI-only) retrieves data from a Backend (REST API + database) via REST DataStore.
* The Frontend authenticates users via Keycloak and includes their token in REST requests.
* The Backend validates OAuth2 tokens and applies the authentication of the user logged into the Client when executing code.

Key implementation details:

* The REST DataStore configuration includes a custom `RestAuthenticator` to forward OAuth2 tokens.
* The security customization includes custom mappers based on classes from Jmix OIDC add-on for synchronizing user data from Keycloak.

By following this guide, developers can implement secure, distributed Jmix applications with external authentication and REST-based data access.
